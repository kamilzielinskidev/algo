- parent node is always gte child nodes for max oriented and lte for min oriented
  - min oriented heaps are used for priority queues, while max are used for sorting most of the time
- keeps the left and right branches balanced
- heap can be represented as array where:
  - root is a[1]
  - child nodes are a[2k] and a[2k+1]
  - parent node is a[k/2]
- heapsort guarantees the N log N time for sorting
- heapsort is not optimal for time and memory (in comparision to quicksort and mergesort) but it's not commonly used because:
  - inner loop takes longer than quick sort's
  - not stable
  - quicksort uses caching (using values nearby instead of in some far places like in heapsort)
