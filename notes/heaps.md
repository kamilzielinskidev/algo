- heaps are used for keeping easy getting the values
- they look like binary tree
- parent node is always lte child nodes
- we try to keep the left and right branches balanced
- while inserting new value, we put it at the bottom and switch the places with parents if needed (while they are lt their parents)
- while deleting the node, we put the inbalanced node in their place and sort the tree from top to the bottom
